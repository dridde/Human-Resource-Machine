# Human-Resource-Machine
The game Human Resource Machine is basically an assembler learning game. I played it some time ago and just finished the last two missing levels (level 40 with the help of the Internet, though).

The game does not save the solutions in the steam cloud, so my solutions would be lost after an uninstall. But the game allows to copy solutions to the clipboard. So i decided to put my solutions on github.

Human Resource Machine levels have 3 goals to reach.
1. Make it work
2. Make it work fast, using as little execution steps as possible 
3. Make it work using as little instructions as possible
Often it is not possible to achieve goal 2 and 3 with the same solution.

Most of my solutions are not optimized, they just solve the level.
